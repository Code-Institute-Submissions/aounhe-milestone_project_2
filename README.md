## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

Real time weather conditions for any location in the world.
#### Key Information for the site

- A user friendly platform wich provides real time weather conditions.

### User Stories

#### Client Goals

- To be able to view the site on a range of device sizes.
- To provide a simple weather guide for all user aibilities.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

weather Check uses this small switch palette, pulled from [Colorso](https://coolors.co/)

### Typography

I used Google Fonts for the following font:

- 'Poppins' for all text content across the website. This is a sans serif font.


### Imagery

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop.

I wanted to focus more on implementing javascript code.

### Features



- A responsive navigation bar and navigation links across the header from right to left as followed - Home, contact. [Bootstrap v5.3]https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navs-tabs/ so that it is easier to view and navigate on a smaller screen.

- The footer consists of instagram and facebook and youtube

*Home Page:*

- The home page is a simple and elegant design. 
- Underneath the Nav bar i used an image of a landcpe including a writing to welcome user and a little disrption about the website.
- Below this I've added a div containing a search form by location.
- The current weather search form provides up-to-date information about the weather conditions for a specific location. It includes essential details such as temperature, cloud cover, the current weather section often displays weather icons or descriptions to give users a quick visual representation of the weather conditions.

- To learn more about this Data platform, click _[here](https://openweathermap.org/guide)_.

*Contact Page:*
- The contact page is very simple.

- I included a form section for user to leave a feedback or get in touch.

### Accessibility

I have ensure that this website is as accessible friendly as possible, I have done the following to achieve this:

- Used semantic HTML.
- Used visually hidden text to describe background images in CSS, where an alt attribute cannot be supplied.
- Included aria-label for website navigation to describe to the screen reader where the user is being taken to.
- Used alt attributes to images in HTML to describe them.
- Using the [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) colour contrast checker to ensure all body text is legible with sufficient contrast.

- unsplash.com - used to download image artwork for website

- IDE: Codeanywhere.com

- API: _[OpenWeatherMap.org](https://openweathermap.org/)_


- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - For the iconography on the website.

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - To import and use the fonts from the website.

- [Color Hex](https://www.color-hex.com/color/79804f) to find a lighter colour tint for the header and footer to pass the contrast checker.

#### API

- OpenWeatherMap provides a fast and easy-to-use weather API that allows developers to access current weather data for any location on Earth, including over 200,000 cities. The One Call API 3.0 is recommended as a starting point for using OpenWeather products . It provides access to current weather and forecasts, including minute forecast for 1 hour, hourly forecast for 48 hours, daily forecast for 8 days, and government weather alerts.

##### API Key
- An application programming interface (API) key is a unique identifier used to authenticate and authorize a user, developer, or calling program to an API. However, they are typically used to authenticate and authorize a project with the API rather than a human user.
- The API key often acts as both a unique identifier and a secret token for authentication and authorization, and will generally have a set of access rights on the API associated with it.

##### Steps to create API Key
- Step 1: Sign up on OpenWeatherMap with your email and password.
- Step 2: After login, visit the "API keys" tab and click on "Get API key and Start" or "Generate" to create a new key.
- Step 3: Copy the API key and paste it to the relevant field in the plugin or program settings where you'll be making API calls.

## Testing

Testing was implemented throughout the entire build of this project. I used Chrome Developer tools to identify and troubleshoot problems along the way.



### W3C Validator

I used W3C HTML Validator on all pages created, and W3C CSS Validator on CSS content.

### JSvalidator

I used JSvalidator on all javascript content.

### Solved Bugs

- I have left the https:// off the beginning of the URL, so it's a relative URL and resolved relative to the document the call is being made from. I just put https:// in front of api.openweathermap.org in the call to fetch
